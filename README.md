# PhysicsReportsGenerator

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to simplify the process of creating reports for physics laboratory classes.  
[Description available here](src/Documentation.txt).

## Running the Example
To run an example from this repository:  
1. Navigate to the parent directory of `src`.
2. Run the following command:  
   ```sh
   python src\main.py

If you create your own report project, absolute paths will be used instead of relative paths.
This allows you to run the application from any location, without being restricted to a specific directory structure.

Take into account that after selecting workspace, it could take relatively long time to display main panel.
