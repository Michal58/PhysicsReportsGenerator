Program searches for settings with name "settings.json" in chosen directory, "settings.json" is
only file needed for recognizing directory as project directory.

Fields of settings.json (they are also listed in settings_namespace.py):
{
    "baseFiles":<path to base files>
    "sourceFiles":<path to source files>
    "generatedFiles":<path to generated files>
}

If project is 'created', in current version new settings file will overwrite another 'setting.json' file
if such exists.

Project will automatically create needed directories defined in settings if they couldn't be found
